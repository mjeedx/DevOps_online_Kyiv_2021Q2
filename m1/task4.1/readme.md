The first task showed to us how hub based network is working.
After we made switched network and watched main differences between them.
There are: switched network is faster, security, effectively, reliable than hub based network
The Last part of the task taught me how a router works, why do we need and how to use it.

I recorded my home task simulations on the video, you can watch them below.
